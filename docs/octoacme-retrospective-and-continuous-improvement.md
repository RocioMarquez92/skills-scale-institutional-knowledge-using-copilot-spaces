# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.
- Sprint retrospectives led by Project Manager
- Release retrospectives led by Release Manager
- Incident post-mortems coordinated by Support Engineer or Release Manager

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner:
- Due date:
- Success criteria:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Ensure cross-role participation (QA Lead, Release Manager, Support Engineer, etc.) to capture diverse perspectives
- Share learnings across teams and update process documentation as needed
