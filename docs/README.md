## Project Management Approach (Summary)
OctoAcme delivers customer value through clear roles, iterative delivery, and strong communication. We use a defined set of processes for project initiation, planning, execution/tracking, risk management, release, retrospectives, and continuous improvement. Our approach ensures transparency, clear ownership, and fast feedback.

**Core principles:**
- Customer-first, iterative delivery
- Data-informed and measurable outcomes
- Transparent ownership and communication
- Focus on quality, risk, and team learning
